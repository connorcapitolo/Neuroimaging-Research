Research for Vanderbilt's Neuroimaging &amp; Brain Dynamics Lab

I am extremely excited about my ongoing research in Catie Chang's lab, where me and my partner, Catherine Kim, are applying data analysis and machine learning methods on resting state fMRI data to predict cognitive and behavioral scores. We intend to publish a paper in 2020 outlining our results. The overall goal is to provide more insights into understanding brain function, specifically neural connectivity, to help analyze and diagnose neurological diseases and disorders like Parkinson’s and ADHD. Currently, we are analyzing fMRI data collected from the Human Connectome Project’s 100 Unrelated Subjects to determine if the cortex, thalamus, or a combination of the two contribute most to determining an individuals’ cognitive scores. We created cortex, thalamus, and cortical-thalamus matrices using functional connectivity with ridge, lasso, elastic net, and K-nearest neighbors regressions to predict cognitive scores like an individual’s processing speed.
